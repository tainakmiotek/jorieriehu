Instead of trading up to a larger vehicle, utilise your small car to the fullest by expanding your cargo space with the URBAN LOADER. I stopped by the local dealership yesterday to look at roof rails and they had a GSW on the showroom floor with a pretty trick looking new box, the Urban Loader. Down, it looks great. Up it looks like a big ol' box and I am cautious about how it would perform on the highway. Anyone have one yet? Primary use would be road trips with a lot of highway miles at 85-90mph. Or would I be better with a more aerodynamic skibox. Some one who loads a lot of expensive software on a computer to raise its' price.

Though organized culling / suggested sterilization programs seem a bit excessive, and I am of the opinion that people should just take care of this problem. This seems like a great problem to have relatively speaking. We have too much healthy delicious meat walking around us, ohh boy, what a problem. I also can't stand people who complain about hunting animals while they eat burgers
