Nana to Kaoru - Read Nana to Kaoru Manga Scans. from Latest My Manga Popular Chapter http://ift.tt/1Ox1AQX. It was recommended here awhile ago, and I forget MAL (https://myanimelist.net/animelist/zerimas1) I'm looking anime/manga that is centred around some type of fetish. I've read Nozoki Ana (https://myanimelist.net/anime/17157/Nozoki_Ana) and I am currently reading Nana to Kaoru (https://myanimelist.net/manga/5994/Nana_to_Kaoru?q=nana%20to), along with a few others. While not an act like voyeurism or SampM I am going to include Ookii Onnanoko wa Suki desu ka? (https://myanimelist.net/manga/73705/Ookii_Onnanoko_wa_Suki_desu_ka)—there's. 
Only following-up on some season's anime right now i spend all my time reading manga, this last 2 weeks i read probably 2-4 complete manga and started following on shonen jumps! Anyway, is Nana to Kaoru what ppl call a doujinshi or something? also, can people recommend me other manga like this, will pick up when i finish I was already into both manga and BDSM, so it was pretty much guaranteed to be catering to my interests, but what I got was a million times better than what I expected. The way the manga handles BDSM in general is fantastic. It focuses on consent and safety, and allows for all the messed-up, human thoughts and emotions that come along with it, without treating them like a bad thing. I love how it featured actual ties and harnesses, and even included things like being "rope drunk", and short. They just released the newest chapters but at the end the caption read the next chapters will be released in 'YA 61', any idea what that means. And when, approximately, we're going to get a domestic release? My googlefu is poor and I'm seriously jonesing to see it (and Black Label) brought over domestically. Hi. I'm weird. I'm looking for a specific type of trope in a manga: the Self-Deprecating MC. He may have a pretty lady that likes him (or dating him) but he feela he isn't good enough for her. I'm looking for something that'd emulate the pang you feel in your heart when you read (perhaps relate) to never feeling good enough for her. Best example I can think of is Nana to Kaoru. Feel free to recommend anything similar or can emulate that pang for me. PS: I say he/she Hi, it's been a while since I've read ecchi, but I finished Domina no Do just now, and I've got the hankering for some more. I want something with constant ecchi and comedy if possible, with no censorship (hate the nipple-less boobs that manga artists do a lot.) I'd like to avoid the Korean sex manhwas because they bore the living crap out of me, but I did enjoy the Hahri's Lumpy series. My favorite ones so far that fit the concept I'm looking for would have to be: Domina Hello /r/manga ! Even if sexual theme or content is very common in anime, it is most of the time superficial, used for comic relief or fan service. Even in Ecchi, a genre that is all about sexuality (in a broad sense), the sexual content is most of the time superficial, unrelated to the action and not consensual ("oops I slipped on your boobs, shoot I saw your panty, goosh I'm forced to kiss you, fack I happened to enter the woman's dressing room). I'd like to read some manga where So I just caught up with Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo suru, and it breaks my heart that there’s not more of it, because I’ve found I really like when the main characters of a romance share an interest or hobby that they bond over, in this case cosplaying, and I’m now looking for similar manga. The only other that I’ve read that follows this trend is (those with delicate sensitivities skip ahead now) Nana to Kaoru, which I also enjoyed immensely (judge me all you want, it was still good). I don’t. The media we consume affects us deeply without us realizing. That's why in 2018 I journalled about EVERY piece of media I consumed. In order to keep it relevant to this sub, I've only mentioned the manga and anime. All the significant entertainment I watched, read or heard in 2018, I penned my thoughts about it. You may find something interesting to you within this. Tell me what you guys think! ----------------------------- January Black Lagoon (7 Jan 2018) : Enjoyed the morality. 
Lately I alway want to read sm manga like "nana to kaoru" or "mina-sama no omoucha desu" Did anyone have a suggestion. I prefer those with a sampm in a little sexual not in the killing story though.
