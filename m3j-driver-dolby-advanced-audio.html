gtTips, suggestions and constructive criticism are welcome! #### PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT gtFrom now on, posts about important leaks and announcements (firmware updates and whatnot) will be required to feature: 1. Accurate, non click-baity titles 2. Links to a reliable source (Nvidia, XDA, etc) or some kind of proof (screenshots, code snippets, etc) 3. Minimal, accurate information. Empty 1 liners are over. Compliant posts will be featured, offenders will be nuked. Thanks!. So I've encountered a seemingly unsolvable problem. Up until last friday, my computer could be set up to work with dolby atmos no problem. With no change since then, windows refuses to let me select dolby atmos in the audio settings. It comes up with an error about selecting spacial sound, or how my device doesn't support this function. I figured out after some troubleshooting that if I uninstalled the Nvidia HD audio driver, I could select Dolby no problem. This works perfectly fine with anythi. I have been searching everywhere to find out the solution to this and I think I just found it In control panel click on hardware and sound (or whatever equivalent for windows 10) we are looking for Dolby advanced audio (if you dont have that installed then any built in PC EQ could be messing it up) For me the EQ was turned on by default, going in and turning off the graphic equalizer as well as the volume leveler and surround visualizer if they are also turned on, stopped my headsets Anyone have anything similar to this situation? I have dolby atmos for home theater WORKING, which is amazing luck in and of itself, but when I switch off atmos and back to 7.1 or any other configuration where I am no longer bitstreaming and sending actual channels (2, 2.1, 5.1, 7.1) windows will not send sound. If I go to advanced setup and configure, either no sound will come out of any specific speaker or it will give me an error. Switch back to atmos and it works fine. Re-installed. Il get straight to the point. I have tested multiple audio devices and all of them have been having issues. \-Main issue : After a few moments of listening to music going about my daily routine (I listen to music 24/7) I have encounter an issue where sounds would start getting Scratchy and distorted slightly. the longer this goes on the worst it gets. It gets so bad that watching YouTube videos the audio is in slow motion and is delayed from the video \-In addition. Windows Audio Manager Like it says in the title, I recently bought Logitech's G430 headset mostly because of CSGO. The problem occured to me twice, I tried using them both with Dolby Digital surround sound turned on and off with CSGO's advanced 3d audio processing, but it seems it doesn't matter. The first time it happened to me, checking file integrity solved the problem, but when it happened yesterday that didn't help. Did anyone have similar problems with G430 and did anyone solve it? And yeah, that only happens. This is a starting template, full guide may be available at some point in the future (assumption, not a guarantee). # TRANSLATOR (https://translate.google.com/#en/es/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2FGamingOptimisations%2Fcomments%2F9z79f5%2Ffull_introduction_from_scratchnothing_to%2F) # Ask questions with Google.com (https://google.com) ========================== #### Table of contents: ##### ◄►►Things to be aware of ##### ►Building a PC - picking components ##### ►Setting. Hello all! Apologies if I shouldn't be posting this here, I just figured you might have the answers I needed since this is a Thinkpad product. I just got this product a few days ago. It has the Dolby Vision, 500 nit display, i7 8650U, 16 GB RAM, 512GB SSD, etc, etc. Unfortunately two issues have come up. The first being that Windows doesn't seem to recognize that the display has HDR. It just says in "Advanced Settings" that it's an SDR Display. I'm not sure why that is or if that's normal. 
Hello all! I just got this laptop a few days ago. It has the Dolby Vision, 500 nit display, i7 8650U, 16 GB RAM, 512GB SSD, etc, etc. Unfortunately two issues have come up. The first being that Windows doesn't seem to recognize that the display has HDR. It just says in "Advanced Settings" that it's an SDR Display. I'm not sure why that is or if that's normal. It just seems strange to me. I can provide a picture of the setting I'm talking about if that would be helpful. The display I spent a long time doing research before finally deciding to purchase the Razer Blade 2017 FHD. In the process, I discovered a large variety of complaints, issues, and problems people were reporting having on their devices. Now, before I continue, understand that I don't believe that this is the end all solution for all the possible problems that can be had with the Blade considering that many people were having issues with their hardware as well (i.e. coil whine, logic board failure, etc). I've been reading about virtual surround sound and 3D audio technologies. It's really fascinating stuff. It seems to me that 3D audio is much more advanced than regular surround sound. It appears that 3D audio existed in the 90s and early 2000s and then went out of style due to Creative's legal actions and Microsoft dropping DirectX support for it (if I'm understanding things correctly). I remember when I had an Alienware as a kid with a Sound Blaster card it had some form of EAX which sounded. {PL} Witam. Zakupiłem mikrofon Tracer Scream’er.

First and foremost, this guide will work with any audio hardware, be it your computer's integrated audio or a 00+ DAC/amp setup (although if you have a setup like that you probably know more than me). That means no ASIO or anything that requires special drivers past the ones needed to get your audio device working. I'll sort it by application and platform. Windows (in general) First of all, turn off all enhancements. If your integrated audio driver has some sort of configuration utility. Hey guys, a few days ago I got a new laptop, I (re)installed Windows 10 and then installed the necessary drivers. The problem now is that 1. the display seems like it has a yellow-ish tint which I can't really get rid of, the colors are very strong and everything seems a bit too dark; the Windows calibration didn't really help, MadVR shows the display is an AUO B173HAN01.0 2. the speakers crackle sometimes and I can't configure the Dolby Advanced Audio v2 software (DAX2) I already. So I've upgraded an X220 from Windows 7 to Windows 10 with a clean format. I installed all the necessary drivers, including the Conexant 20672 driver, version 8.32.43.0 rev2, that is compatible with Windows 10. Normally the driver (from my experience with other models) installs Dolby in itself, but this did not. So I googled, and I've been googling and testing methods for about 3-4 days now. What I've tried is; (every try includes uninstalling the Conexant driver, reboot, reinstall So I bought a T470 and I must say I quite like it. The one thing that really bothers me is the poor audio when running Linux due to the missing Dolby Advanced Audio driver. Is there a (not stupid) way to fix this? I read somewhere that this feature is part of the hardware and maybe replacing the speakers could do the trick. I am using Dolby advanced audio v2 on Windows 10(64bit).though the drivers were unsigned I installed it because it was my favourite ( sadly dolby hasn't made it compatible with win 10). While watching movies I noticed that when there was no music (silent scenes) there was low cracking/krrrr sound. This small noise is completely ruining my audio experience. Please inform me how I can resolve this issue. I also noticed that when using 24bit(studio quality) this was reduced but still persists. My PC is connected to my samsung surround system via a digital audio cable. I did what this guy suggested (https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/unlocked-realtek-hd-audio-drivers-windows-7-8-10-with-dolby-digital-live-and-dts-interactive.193148/page-62#post-3543535) and now when l go to Playback Devices , click Properties on Digital Output(Optical) amp go to Advanced , I can select Dolby Digital Live or DTS Interactive , but pressing Test on either 
Is there any way updating VLC would kill my audio system? I updated to 2.2.6 two nights ago, and Dolby Digital Live stopped working on my PC. It was working the previous day, it was working an hour earlier. The only change made was updating VLC. I went to watch a movie, it prompted for an update, I installed, and Dolby has been dead since then. No windows updates, no driver updates. I'm on Win10 and installed Creator's Update a couple weeks ago, and everything worked fine. </p>
